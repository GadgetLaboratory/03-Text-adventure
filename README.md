# 03-Text-adventure
A text adventure RPG made for Game Technology class.  This is the upper limit of what I can do before really diving deep into this class.

# So, I tried to do a LOT with this text adventure.  A lot more than I needed to, in fact.  I've decided to abandon it as far as a class assignment, but maybe I'll finish it one day when I'm far less constrained.  I'm hoping I can at least get brownie points for what all I attempted to do.
# In the main file, you will find SEVERAL more functions than simply moving around and grabbing/using items.  I tried to implement NPCs, a decent enough story, elaboration on items, and a *combat system with special skills*.  And if I had more time to do it all, I would probably be able to finish it.  Sadly, I am behind enough as it is.
# Here's to hoping you can at least have some enjoyment in what all I'd planned to do.  Who knows?  Maybe I might be able to revisit this for a future project.
